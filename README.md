"Development of massive parallel approaches for farmers complaints through text and images using high performance computing"

Plants disease detection is very popular field of study. Many promising results were already obtained but it is still only few real-life applications that can make farmerâ€™s life easier. The aim of our research is solving the problem of detection and preventing diseases of agricultural crops with the help of deep learning. We collected a special database of the grapes leaves consisting of four set of images, including healthy, Esca, Black rot and Chlorosis diseases. We reached over 90% accuracy using a deep siamese convolutional network.
